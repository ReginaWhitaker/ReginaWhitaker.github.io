				Step 1: Determine the Discretionary Spending Categories
				
			</div>

			<div class="stepContent">

				<div class="stepDescription">
					<p>This course places a significant emphasis on understanding discretionary spending. By gaining a clear understanding of the categories in which you spend your discretionary income, you will be empowered to make informed financial decisions.</p>
					<p>One of the fundamental concepts in budgeting is distinguishing between your needs and wants. Your basic needs as an individual are:</p>
				<ul>
						<li>Food</li>
						<li>Shelter</li>
						<li>Water</li>
						<li>Transportation</li>
				</ul>
					
					<p>When determining your categories, look at the last two bank and credit card statements and mark how many transactions you have that fall under these categories:
				</p>
				<ul>
						<li>Dining Out</li>
						<li>Clothes</li>
						<li>Entertainment</li>
						<li>Gas</li>
						<li>Dining Out</li>
						<li>Clothes</li>
						<li>Entertainment</li>
						<li>Groceries</li>
						<li>Travel</li>
						<li>Hobbies</li>
						<li>Shopping</li>
						<li>Other Miscellaneous</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Once you've tallied the number of transactions for each category, take the top five. These will form the starting point for your discretionary budget.

			Step 2: Determine the Budget Amount
		</div>

			<div class="stepContent">

				<div class="stepDescription">
					<p>Now that you have determined your budget categories, it is time to create your personalized budget. As you embark on creating your personalized budget, a crucial step is to review your bank and credit card statements. These statements will serve as a valuable resource in determining your budget categories. Identify the five categories that you spend the most on, as these will be your main categories for tracking discretionary spending. Add up the amounts you spent in each category and note the highest total for each category by month. This data will form the foundation of your personalized budget.</p>
					<p>If you want to start the system immediately, you can start with these general categories: gas, groceries, allowance, and eating out. These categories encompass a large number of non-mandatory/discretionary expenses.</p>
					<p>To help demonstrate how to utilize the cash envelope system, we will use the following budget categories and amounts.</p>
				<ul>
						<li>Gas - $120</li>
						<li>Eating Out - $100</li>
						<li>Groceries - $400</li>
						<li>Allowance - $120 weekly ($480)</li>
						<li>Total - $1100 Month</li>
				</ul>
				</div>

				Step 3: Withdraw Money from Bank
			</div>

			<div class="stepContent">

				<div class="stepDescription">
				<p>Now that you have determined the budget categories and amounts, you can go to the bank and withdraw the funds.</p>
				<p>Go to the bank and withdraw $1100 for the month. If you get paid bi-weekly or weekly, split the budget number of weeks. This regularity in managing your finances will provide a sense of security and stability. You will need to go to the bank weekly for your budgeted amount. When you start budgeting, it may be better to withdraw your weekly budgeted amount to ensure you stay within budget.</p> 
				<p>Note: It is very important that you exercise discipline and control by only swiping or utilizing credit cards or debit cards if you have no choice. If you do use credit cards, then immediately take the cash and pay that amount to the credit card company that day.</p>
				<p>It is essential to withdraw certain denominations for each cash envelope category. There is a psychological tie between releasing a large number of bills and releasing a large denomination of a bill. If you have a $20, you will spend a $20. If you have to release four $5 bills, continuing spending may be more difficult.</p>
				<p>When you go to the bank, withdraw these denominations</p>
				<ul>
						<li>Gas – (12) - $10 Bills</li>
						<li>Groceries – (4) - $100 Bills</li>
						<li>Eating Out – (10) - $10 Bills</li>
						<li>Allowance – (24) - $5 Bills</li>
						<li>Allowance – (24) - $5 Bills</li>
						<li>Allowance – (24) - $5 Bills</li>
						<li>Allowance – (24) - $5 Bills</li>
				</ul>
	
					<p>Total</p>
		
				<ul>
						<li>(22) - $10 Bills - $220</li>
						<li>(4) - $100 Bills - $400</li>
						<li>(96) - $5 Bills - $480</li>
						<li>Total - 1100</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="stepDescription">
			<p> Now that you have withdrawn the money from the bank, it is time to start working the cash envelope system. </p>
			<p>Label eight envelopes with the category title and amount to be placed in the envelope.</p>

			<p>Count out 12 - $10 Bills and place in the Gas Envelope</p>

				Step 5: How to Manage Money
			</div>

			<div class="stepContent">

				<div class="stepDescription">
					
					<p> Now that you have filled your envelopes, you can manage and budget your money. 
					<p> Note: Even though you may go to the bank monthly or bi-monthly, you should only carry some money. You should only have:</p>
					<p> 1 – Allowance Envelope a week</p>
					<p> 2 – Keep the gas envelope with enough money for gas in the car glovebox</p>
					<p> 3 – Pull out $100 weekly and take no credit cards to the grocery store. </p>
					<p> 4 – Decide how many days you can afford to eat out and take that amount out when you leave the house for dinner.</p>
					<p> Find a secure spot in your home to keep your envelopes. The only envelopes you should have access to as you live your daily life are your allowance and gas envelopes. The grocery, eating out, and other weekly allowance envelopes should be in a secure place at home.</p>
					<p> As you spend money from your envelopes, tracking your expenses is essential. Write down your amount and what you spent directly on the Envelope. This practice of tracking your expenses is invaluable. It gives you a clear picture of your financial situation and helps you make informed decisions. If you have money left over at the end of the week from your grocery or allowance budget envelopes, place that money in a savings envelope or pay it directly towards a credit card or loan bill. Even if you have .05 cents left over, pay that immediately towards a bill, it really adds up.</p>
					<p> Note: Remember, the money must last until your next pay period. You should not carry all the money with you. This requires discipline and a strong commitment to your budget, but it will empower you to take control of your finances.

				<div class="stepDescription">
				<p>Once a week, evaluate your spending. If the envelope is empty before your next pay period, then you are done spending it in that category. Over time, it will get easier to manage. Place any amount of money you save each week into a savings account or envelope or pay towards a bill. You will be surprised how quickly the debt goes down, and the savings go up! More importantly, you will gain a sense of security and peace through managing your money.</p>
