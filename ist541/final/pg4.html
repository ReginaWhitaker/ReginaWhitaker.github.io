        <p>The first step</p>
        <p>The first step in outsourcing your life is to write down all the domestic and personal tasks you are responsible for daily, weekly, or monthly.</p>

          <li>Cooking</li>
          <li>Grocery Shopping</li>

      <summary class="stepTitle"> Step 2: Research Companies to do the Tasks (Outsource) </summary>
      <div class="stepContent">
        <div class="stepDescription">
          <p>The next step is to research, via the Internet or personal referral, a company or individual who can do those tasks for you.</p>
          <br>
          <p>If you want to start the system immediately, you can start with these general categories: gas, groceries, allowance, and eating out. These categories encompass a large number of non-mandatory/discretionary expenses.</p>
          <br>
          <p>To help demonstrate how to utilize the cash envelope system, we will use the following budget categories and amounts.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
          <p>1. Google: What companies can I have my groceries delivered?
            What companies will wash and fold my laundry?</p>
          <p>2. Yelp â€“ Look on Yelp for companies near you and read their reviews</p>
          <p>3. Read the Google reviews on the company before you use them.</p>
          <p>4. Post on the Neighbor Next Door site for referrals for companies that can provide the service.</p>
          <p>5. Check the Care.Com app to see the prices for these services. The individuals who work through the site are vetted, providing an extra layer of assurance about the quality of service. </p>

      <div class="stepContent">
        <div class="stepDescription">
          <p>Start by creating a budget for your monthly bills. This will give you a clear picture of your financial situation. Then, look at your discretionary spending, such as eating out, coffee, and shopping. Consider if you can cut back on these expenses. Once you've identified the least expensive task to outsource, you can start there. </p>

      <div class="stepContent">
        <div class="stepDescription">
          <p> Outsourcing can be a significant emotional, mental, and financial change. Many people are used to performing all these tasks independently. </p>
          <p>Loosening the hold and allowing someone to take over these tasks can be challenging. For instance, many people delay getting a maid until they clean up a bit because of embarrassment. Remember, they are professionals. They have seen all kinds of homes in different states. This is why you need them.</p>
          <p>Many people feel they can't afford to outsource tasks. However, if you examine your spending habits and cut back on frivolous expenses, you may find that you can afford to outsource at least one task. It's a matter of prioritizing your spending.</p>
          <p>Don't overwhelm yourself by outsourcing everything at once. Start with one task a month and gradually increase. This approach allows you to learn and adjust to outsourcing over time, leading to a more satisfying experience.</p>

      <div class="stepContent">
      <div class="stepDescription">
      <p> After fully implementing your outsourcing plan, evaluate whether you are happy with the service or need to find someone else. Not everyone will be an immediate good fit; try a few companies or people to outsource to before you give up. <br>
        <br>
        <strong> NOTE:</strong>Understand that you are  partnering with those you are outsourcing to. Be kind and respectful, and  communicate your needs. The best-outsourced experiences are those of  cooperation. They have a job to do and seek to have a happy customer  experience. </p>
